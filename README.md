# 2-Stage_OP_AMP
Designed and analyzed a 2-stage CMOS operational amplifier in 0.18μm technology with VDD=1.8V and 1pF load capacitance. Achieved ≥60° phase margin, ≥60 dB DC gain, ≤−20 dB common-mode gain, >100 MHz unity gain bandwidth, ≥10 V/μs slew rate, and ≥800 mVpp output swing, while minimizing overall power consumption
